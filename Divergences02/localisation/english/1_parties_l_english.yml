national_rejuvenatism:0 "National Rejuvenatism"
national_rejuvenatism_desc:0 "National rejuvenation is a phrase attributed to a specific kind of revolutionary and nationalist movements which aim to strengthen the nation and enhance its cultural life by forging a new national identity. This reinvigoration is achieved through uniting closely related cultural groups, revising tradition and formulating a new mythos. National Rejuvenation is a radically modernist and technophilic ideology which stands in opposition to both capitalism and communism alike, supports some degree of state-guided economy and is usually highly authoritarian, believing that a nation can only be brought into a brighter future with the strong hand of the state. However, there exist exceptions to that rule which advocate complete rejection of state apparatus."
futurism:0 "Futurism"
futurism_desc:0 "Futurism is an avant-garde artistic and socio-political movement which originated in Italy at the dawn of the Great War and has since inspired various political movements all around the world. Although its concept of a desired economic and political structure varies from country to country, futurism is commonly characterised by glorification of modernity, worship of technological innovations, anti-capitalism and rejection of all things considered traditional or bourgeois. The most significant branches of Futurist thought are concentrated in Europe: a fervently nationalist ideology promoting youth and militant heroism in the west, and a movement closely tied to international communism in the east."
technocracy:0 "Technocracy"
technocracy_desc:0 "Technocracy presents a project of a social order in which governance is conducted through scientific methods instead of a popular, spiritual or dictatorial mandate. Though the implementation of these methods varies among different governments, the constants are an establishment of an extensive bureaucracy, limitations placed on the democratic process, and elements of economic planning instituted to various degrees. The social and economic forces compromising a society are to be understood and sufficiently mastered, then directed towards some kind of common good through the practice of social engineering. To achieve this goal, technocrats support advancements in technology, seeing methods used in its production as analogous to ones that can be useful in organizing a state."

anarchism:0 "Anarchist"
anarchism_noun:0 "Anarchism"
anarchism_desc:0 "Anarchist Collective"
social_anarchism:0 "Social Anarchism"
social_anarchism_desc:0 "Social anarchism is an umbrella term for doctrines of revolutionary anarchism that advocate direct democracy, abolition of private property (though some strains retain respect for personal property) and restructuring of society along non-hierarchical lines. Deriving from teachings of Kropotkin, Bakunin, and to a certain degree Proudhon, social anarchist thought puts an emphasis on mutual aid as interrelated with individual freedom and endorses common or cooperative ownership of the means of production. The most notable currents of social anarchism are: anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism and collectivist anarchism."
individualist_anarchism:0 "Individualist Anarchism"
individualist_anarchism_desc:0 "Individualist anarchism is a broad set of anarchist views which break with the more mainstream and mass oriented strains of anarchism. While differing widely in worldview all place the individual and their will over external determinants such as groups, tradition, and other societal systems. These currents range from Thoreau's isolation in the woods, to the philosophies of natural right espoused by Godwin and Spooner, to illegalism and Stirner's total egoism. Although anarcho-individualism disagrees with social branches of anarchism, they often work together to achieve common goals, including abolition of hierarchy and all exploitative property."
stateless_anarchy:0 "Lawlessness"
stateless_anarchy_desc:0 "Lawlessness is not an ideology, but rather a situation of a complete collapse of all authority in a region as a result of either mismanagement or the previously existing government being destroyed. This term can also describe geographical areas which have never been organized into a state."

vanguard_socialism:0 "Vanguard Socialist"
vanguard_socialism_noun:0 "Vanguard Socialism"
vanguard_socialism_desc:0 "Socialist Regime"
leninism:0 "Leninism"
leninism_desc:0 "Leninism is the name applied to the school of socialist thought that developed around exiled Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. A product of the situation observed in Russia and other countries where the working class was not as established and politically active as that of Germany, this tendency advocates for a revolutionary vanguard party to organize and educate the workers toward their own emancipation. Furthermore, it calls for a "dictatorship of the proletariat" as a tool to revolutionize the country along the path to socialism and communism. Also informed by the ideologue's Russian experience is a support for national self-determination in order to settle issues of ethnocentrism and oppression that are considered distractions from class struggle."
national_vanguardism:0 "National Vanguardism"
national_vanguardism_desc:0 "National vanguardism is a term describing radical political movements which combine socialism with nationalist messaging. Typically advocating a state-run economy and a one-party state led by a revolutionary vanguard, this tendency advocates a turn to nationalism in order to secure and protect the revolution. Through upholding that identity, militarism, and national glory, the national vanguardist project is to strengthen the appeal of socialism within the nation and prepare it for revolutionary struggle with its enemies, both within and without."
state_socialism:0 "State Socialism"
state_socialism_desc:0 "State socialism is a political system in which the country is placed under the tutelage of a political vanguard, which operates a socialist economy in a top-down manner. Sometimes occurring as a transitional stage following the revolution, this term alludes to existing Marxist theories of socialism, but is not necessarily a part of them, serving as a catch-all for states not adequately described by other vanguard socialist ideologies."
social_republicanism:0 "Social Republicanism"
social_republicanism_desc:0 "The word Republic derives from the Latin phrase Res Publica, meaning public affair. Yet for so many so-called \"republicans,\" the states they construct are not truly of the people, but simply a license for license. A freedom to be left alone. What a farce! How can a citizen be free when their neighbor, their city, their nation, and their world is enslaved? This is the downfall of the \"civil republic,\" which, in reality, is nothing more than machinations of capital and false liberty.\n\nSocial Republicanism emerged out of a dissatisfaction with the notion of a civil republic, as well as the cosmopolitan stain it left on socialism as a whole. The term finds its origins in the revolutionary left of 1848, those brave Communards and patriots who pushed back against the liberal wings of the revolutions across Europe. These often maligned heroes were those who stood valiantly against the states of yore, attempting to set up a republic truly made of and ruled by the peoples of a nation, not one of a nation ruling the peoples.\n\nOpposed to the simple application of universalist principles, Social Republicanism emphasizes the need to look at the traditions of liberty among a national body, following the thread of justice through the fabric of time. A social republic is not a state, nor a polis of Plato, but the organization of the entire national demos as rulers of themselves. Because of its ties to particular histories and nations, its manifestations are as numerous as countries, yet all hold common principles such as a commitment to democracy, a focus on national romanticism, and the need of a vanguard of, by, and for the people to guide the republic. Nevertheless, in all cases, it weaves a story of liberation and anti-domination throughout the ages, one in which the living are no more privileged than the dead, and which the flame of the ancestors is brought forward, leaving the ashes of the past behind."

popular_socialism:0 "Popular Socialist"
popular_socialism_noun:0 "Popular Socialism"
popular_socialism_desc:0 "Socialist Regime"
spartakism:0 "Spartakism"
spartakism_desc:0 "Spartakism, sometimes called Luxemburgism after one of its foremost figures, is the term for the school of socialism that came to occupy the mainstream of the global far left after the Great War. The example forged by the German Revolution includes a number of precepts: first, fervent internationalism; second, rejection of the "vanguard party" concept in favor of multiparty democracy between factions that support the revolution; and third, partly owing to the circumstances in Germany at the end of the Great War, anti-militarism and anti-imperialism. Originally springing from a modern industrial capitalist society, it has the strongest presence in states with a large and developed urban proletariat."
syndicalism:0 "Syndicalism"
syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a strain of socialist thought that views revolutionary industrial unionism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of the economy and, with that control, influence broader society. Syndicalists consider their economic theories a strategy for facilitating worker self-activity and as an alternative co-operative economic system with production centered on meeting human needs. Usually syndicalist movements advocate some form of central government to coordinate production, as well as in the use of a revolutionary political party in addition to union action to achieve its goals."
folk_socialism:0 "Folk Socialism"
folk_socialism_desc:0 "Folk socialism is a strain of socialism aspiring to the goals and methods of spartakism or syndicalism while being understanding of the needs and circumstances of an un- or under-developed polity. Without a developed urban proletariat, it typically makes greater appeals to rural and peasant populations, recognizing their values and interests while still attempting to lift them from their material conditions through the establishment of socialism. As a result, folk socialism typically has a greater presence in current and recently-liberated colonial territories, as well as among other "pre-capitalist" states."

revisionist_socialism:0 "Revisionist Socialist"
revisionist_socialism_noun:0 "Revisionist Socialism"
revisionist_socialism_desc:0 "Socialist Regime"
democratic_socialism:0 "Democratic Socialism"
democratic_socialism_desc:0 "Democratic socialism is a political ideology which seeks to establish a socialist economic system through reformist rather than revolutionary methods. As the name suggests, it supports democratic process of management both in the political system and within enterprises. Democratic socialists see capitalism as inherently incompatible with values of liberty, equality and solidarity, and believe that the issues inherent to capitalism can only be solved by superseding private ownership with some form of social ownership."
religious_socialism:0 "Religious Socialism"
religious_socialism_desc:0 "Religious socialism is an umbrella term for schools of socialism that have found common cause between the materialist ideology and certain aspects of a faith. Movements and figures in the past are sometimes claimed as prototypical religious socialists, but currently, principles such as solidarity and social justice, as well as anti-imperialism or anti-capitalism, have led to the explicit fusion of the two philosophies. Social policy under religious socialism varies depending on the faith and how literal the movement's adherence to it is."
agrarian_socialism:0 "Agrarian Socialism"
agrarian_socialism_desc:0 "Agrarian socialism refers to movements fusing socialism and the agriculturalist way of life. Rather than mainly being concerned with control over the means of industrial production, it emphasizes the land, often stressing collective ownership and local autonomy, or that socialism can be achieved without progressing through a capitalist phase of development. As a result, Agrarian Socialism has its strongest appeal in areas that are predominantly rural and pre-industrial."

progressivism:0 "Progressive"
progressivism_noun:0 "Progressivism"
progressivism_desc:0 "Democratic Regime"
progressive_democracy:0 "Progressive Democracy"
progressive_democracy_desc:0 "Progressive democracy is a political doctrine deriving from the progressive movement of the United States which advocates extensive social and economic reforms. Its aim is to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy by progressive taxation, regulations imposed on large corporations and various means of providing aid to the disadvantaged. Progressives are committed to parliamentary democracy and advocate for distribution of assets as widely as possible in order to reach a political system where every man and woman has equality of opportunity."
left_populism:0 "Left-wing Populism"
left_populism_desc:0 "Left-wing populism refers to political movements advocating action for the benefit of the common people, understood generally as the lower classes of the country rather than financial, social, or political elites. Broadly, it supports regulation of the economy for the general interest, coupled with state investment and welfare provisions. Left-wing populism in a country may also constitute a movement or party united behind a specific public figure and their policies."
social_nationalism:0 "Social Nationalism"
social_nationalism_desc:0 "Social nationalism, also known as left-wing nationalism, is an ideology which is based upon the principles of social equality and popular sovereignty while retaining the belief in the necessity of upholding some cultural or national identity. Similarly to other progressive movements, it endorses state regulation of the economy combined with various forms of social aid. Social nationalism has its roots in Jacobinism of the French Revolution and became popularised among many national independence movements retaliating against foreign imperialism. Although it stands in contrast to right-wing nationalism and typically rejects ethnic nationalism, some more radical interpretations of this ideology aren't unheard of."

liberalism:0 "Liberal"
liberalism_noun:0 "Liberalism"
liberalism_desc:0 "Democratic Regime"
classical_liberalism:0 "Classical Liberalism"
classical_liberalism_desc:0 "Classical liberalism is the original form of liberalism established by the American and French Revolutions. Classical liberalism advocates for equality of political rights and legal status for all while seeking to restrict political participation to the wealthier classes to some extent. It tends to support smaller states with enumerated powers, separation of church and state, and checks and balances between separate branches of government, along with laissez-faire economics, private property, and class paternalism. Classical liberal movements are usually republican, though they may also support strictly constitutional monarchies."
social_liberalism:0 "Social Liberalism"
social_liberalism_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a political ideology that believes individual liberty requires a level of social justice. Like classical liberalism, social liberalism endorses a market economy and the expansion of civil and political rights and liberties, but differs in that it believes the legitimate role of the government includes addressing economic and social issues through pragmatic state intervention. Under social liberalism, the good of the community is viewed as harmonious with the freedom of the individual."
libertarian_capitalism:0 "Libertarian Capitalism"
libertarian_capitalism_desc:0 "Libertarian capitalism is a radical form of liberalism advocating for total maximisation of personal freedom and reducing the role of the State to the possible minimum, which is expected to serve exclusively as a watchman protecting individual rights and largely rejecting the importance of groups such as class or ethnicity. Embracing a laissez-faire approach to economy, libertarian capitalists argue that only under a free market the individual can fully exercise their freedom, categorically condemning any form of collectivism or interventionism as tyranny. With its roots going as far back as Classical Liberalism of the Enlightenment the main currents of Libertarian Capitalism are the European political ideas connected to the Austrian School of Economics."

conservatism_desc:0 "Democratic Regime"
social_conservatism:0 "Social Conservatism"
social_conservatism_desc:0 "Social conservatism is an attitude that tends to favour beliefs seen as traditional in regard to social affairs, including moral issues. Social conservatism is generally sceptical of social change, and believes in maintaining the status quo concerning social issues such as family life, sexual relations and patriotism."
national_conservatism:0 "National Conservatism"
national_conservatism_desc:0 "National conservatism is used to describe nationalist groups that advocate for their national interest first and foremost, with preserving a perceived social status quo or ideals being their chief other concern. National conservatives can espouse support for democracy or parliamentarianism, but often view the national interest as something that supersedes the rights of its citizens."
liberal_conservatism:0 "Liberal Conservatism"
liberal_conservatism_desc:0 "Liberal conservatism is a term describing a fusion of more classically liberal ideals with a conservative stance, valuing individuality as well as the society and nation. While in general they tend to be laissez-faire when it comes to capitalism, they are still highly skeptical of social change, with reforms only being considered if they seem truly necessary. Liberal conservatism also highly values the rule of law, with constitutions, institutions, and statutes being seen as irrevocable, eschewing violent and extreme means of gaining power or changing in favor of keeping the state stable."

right_authoritarianism:0 "Right-Wing Authoritarian"
right_authoritarianism_noun:0 "Right-Wing Authoritarianism"
right_authoritarianism_desc:0 "Authoritarian Regime"
anocracy:0 "Anocracy"
anocracy_desc:0 "Anocracy is used to refer to a state that shares both democratic and authoritarian features. Most of them are dominant-party systems — that is, states where opposition parties are allowed and elections are held, but the ruling party's power is rarely threatened. Sometimes this position is maintained through outright election fraud, while at others the ruling party has a major structural advantage while campaigning. An anocracy may also only select competing candidates from its ruling elite."
oligarchy:0 "Oligarchy"
oligarchy_desc:0 "Oligarchy or plutarchy is a form of power structure in which power rests with a small number of people. These people might be distinguished by nobility, wealth, family ties, education or corporate, religious or military control. Oligarchies are not democratic, though they may operate a parliament or senate system. They usually operate a deeply stratified society and economy explicitly for the benefit of those in power."
corporatocracy:0 "Corporatocracy"
corporatocracy_desc:0 "Corporatocracy is a system that blends the state and corporations. Often used to describe governments which rely on, or are heavily supported financially by, a small number of large private interests; such that the government cannot be said to be truly separate from those companies themselves. Corporatocracies run their governments for the benefit of the corporations in control of them, often to the detriment of their citizens or an under-class of citizens."

despotism_desc:0 "Authoritarian Regime"
absolute_monarchy:0 "Absolute Monarchy"
absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "Absolute monarchy is a form of monarchy in which one ruler has supreme authority and where that authority is not restricted by any written laws, legislature, or customs. While the Monarch may depend on a circle of close advisors or ministers, his prerogatives remain above natural law and derive legitimacy from an equation of his position to the state itself."
military_dictatorship:0 "Military Dictatorship"
military_dictatorship_desc:0 "Military dictatorship is an autocratic form of government in which the state apparatus is wholly under the control of a high-ranking military officer. It is often claimed to be a temporary measure in order to prevent a takeover by other, radical movements. Under its aegis, state security forces are empowered against dissent, the government may exert a larger influence over the economy, and the state may pursue an "army-first" policy when allocating funding. Sometimes, a cult of personality is employed to give the regime further legitimacy."
constitutional_dictatorship:0 "Constitutional Dictatorship"
constitutional_dictatorship_desc:0 "Constitutional dictatorship is a phrase referring to a system of government where a single civil leader, whether a prime minister or president, has been granted absolute power through legal procedures. Said power could be given as a measure to protect the country in times of emergency or as a result of abusing the faulty political system. Constitutional dictators are usually accompanied by a cult of personality and have their power backed and protected by legislations."
theocracy:0 "Theocracy"
theocracy_desc:0 "Who can rule wiser and fairer than the men of the Divine? Who can know justice better than those who dedicated themselves to the sacred matters? For Theocracy, there is no answer – as there is no divide between spiritual and temporal power. \n\nDespite the onslaught of modernity, a few places in the world still are home to states traditionally ruled by the representatives of a local religion. Be it a powerful hierarch of the clergy, a scheming leader of a heretical sect or a charismatic prophet – all Theocrats draw their power on the mandate of faith, their state being the realisation of divine will on Earth. Yet, this will can take many shapes. Though usually conservative, Theocrats do not necessarily see progress as an evil, corrupting force and sometimes call for religious, social and political reform, clearly differing from fundamentalist reactionaries. \n\nMany say that in the storm of the modern world God has died – that Theocracy should be banished to history books. Yet, isn't it also said that faith alone can move mountains?"

reactionary_populism_desc:0 "Reactionary populism is an ideology which aims to facilitate the reconstruction of a certain political or economic state from the past by mass organization against the current establishment or revolutionary movements. It is characterised by its support for paternalism, social solidarity and often virulent nationalism. Reactionary populists put an emphasis on tradition, religion and hierarchy, and radically oppose modern ideals by recalling the collective memory of \"good old times\"."
religious_fundamentalism:0 "Religious Fundamentalism"
religious_fundamentalism_desc:0 "Religious fundamentalism is a political stance that defends the authority of the law, the principles, and the institutions of particular religious beliefs. Religious Fundamentalists advocate their position based upon their belief that their religion, or sometimes - the deity or deities themselves through an earthly intermediary - must hold total control of politics in society. This system would then pursue radical reforms to accommodate for this theocratic and traditionalist interpretation of dogma. Among the groups that adhere to this position are certain schools of Islam and Buddhism, Hindu sects, and ultra-reactionary interpretations of Christianity, although many other circles may fall under this specific label."
esoteric_reactionism:0 "Reactionary Esotericism"
esoteric_reactionism_desc:0 "Clamoring for times long gone, reactionary esotericists form the most harsh opposition to social change and progress. Believing that the mythos has been lost in exchange for the logos in the process of human history, they advocate for restoration of an ancient time, usually referring to a once-great civilization, accompanying spiritual values, traditional morality and ancient social strata. Reactionary esotericists are often present in secret clubs or small, aristocratic societies, usually spouting mysticism and other forms of connecting to the metaphysical."
